Project Name: Visualizing and Predicting Heart Diseases with an Interactive Dash Board



Elements - Components - Unit ( Module )- C function 
SWE 03

Inputs : 
Software Requirements Analysis 
	It have Non-requirement Function is used Know which way of coding is written

Software Architecture
	Used to Brake Entire Software into Small Picese ( Unit / Modules )
	Develop each Module Independently


Software Project Mangement
	Which Moudle are release first and which is later 

What a unit is: 
For example, a unit can be a C file, a method or function, or an atomic element in a model
What is in detailed design specification for software component: 
Usually includes the algorithms used, defined interactions and interface specifications. Flow and state diagrams, message sequence charts, UML diagrams, and natural language descriptions 
What needs to be taken into account for unit construction:
Development must be carried out taking into account the coding guidelines and standards 

Software requirement analysis
→ Software requirements especially non functional requirements constraining the way code is written
Software architecture
→ The black box specifications of the components to be designed, coded and built
Software project management
→ SW release plan, iteration plan
Software configuration management
→ Stable, consistent baselines for all inputs
Platform development 
→ SW components for reuse or as basis for development
